# What are Data Structures?

## Understanding exactly what data structures are and why they are important.

Data Structure are very **simply a way** of **organizing the data** that is **stored in a computer** or **in a database**.

There are **multiple different types** of data structures and each type of data structure represents a different **way** of organizing the data that is **stored**. 


## Why are there different types of daa structures?

**Each** data structures has its own **strengths** and its own **weaknesses**.

- Some data structures are **very fast at storing**, and **recording data** but they're **slow searching through data** and retrieving it.

- Other data structures are the exact opposite, there are **slow at storing data** but **fast** and **retrieving it**.

So, each type of data structure can be **useful** for **different reasons**. 

### That is physically what data structures are in computer science.

## Why are data structures important to know?

Data structures in programming has a lot of value in it for many reasons.

1. One reason is that **using data structures correctly** in our programming can **highly affect how fast performance** and **efficiently** your applications run.

2. If we are constantly storing data but we are not going to be retrieving it that much. For example, let's say that a programmer work at Twitter and he is in charge of storing really old tweets in a database. Then, in this case, he would want a data structure like a [Linked list](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2019/01/computer-science-in-javascript-linked-list) which is really **fast at recording a lot of data** even though **it's not the fastest at retrieving that data**.

3. On the other hand if we want to store very recent tweets in a way that allows a lot of people to view them very quickly we are going to want to use data structure that can access data quickly such as a [Hast table](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-a-simple-hash-table-in-javascript-cb3b9c1f2997).

4. Another reason to know how to code data structures in JavaScript in that it really helps us to nail down JavaScript algorithms and a lot of important concepts that are pretty crucial to having a thorough understanding of programming and JavaScript.
Like: __*construction functions*__, __*recursion*__ the __*`this` keyword*__, the __*prototype object*__, __*Big O notation*__, etc.


## Conclusion
So, there are a lot of **benefits** to knowing data structures and how to code them out in JavaScript. 
**Using the correct data structure** in our programming can be **very crucial** for **making applications run smoothly quickly** and **fficiently**.
